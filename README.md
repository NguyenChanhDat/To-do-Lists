This is my first personal web app project in my developing career so as you can guest, it's really bad in term of files system structure, clean-coding and other stuff... 
But i'll still keep this as a milestone of the begining of my journey, kind like a good memory to me
I also have the 2nd repo which I'll refactor it as much professional as i can by Java Spring Boot deploy for online user
Thanks for take a look at this repo, hope you like the 2nd version :)
